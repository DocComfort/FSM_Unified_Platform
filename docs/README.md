# Documentation Index

This directory centralizes architecture decisions, migration guides, API references, and onboarding paths for the FSM Unified Platform.

## Suggested Structure

- `architecture/` – ADRs, diagrams, module ownership.
- `guides/` – Setup scripts, Supabase workflow instructions, deployment runbooks.
- `migrations/` – Schema merge notes, data normalization plans.
- `playbooks/` – Feature integration checklists, testing matrices, release cadences.

## Immediate TODOs

1. Draft an ADR outlining the unified Supabase schema approach.
2. Document environment setup for contributors (Node, Expo, Supabase CLI, VS Code tasks).
3. Capture the migration plan for calculators, AI assistants, and Twilio edge functions.
4. Add testing standards spanning Vitest, Jest/Expo, and pgTAP for database policies.
